# FlowFixer — Product Requirements Document

> **Project:** FlowFixer — AI Bug Tutor for VS Code
> **Theme:** Education
> **Event:** 24-Hour Hackathon (CHD)
> **Team Size:** 3 Engineers (Full Stack)
> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-13

---

## 1. Problem Statement

"Vibe coding" has created a generation of developers who ship code they don't understand. AI tools like Copilot and Cursor fix bugs silently — the developer clicks "accept" and moves on without learning what went wrong or why. There is no feedback loop between fixing a bug and understanding it.

**The result:** Students and junior devs build speed but not skill. They hit the same bugs repeatedly. They can't debug without AI. They have no vocabulary for the mistakes they make.

---

## 2. Solution

A VS Code extension that intercepts AI-assisted bug fixes and turns each one into a micro-learning moment:
- Shows **what** changed (visual diff)
- Shows **how** it looks (live preview before/after)
- Explains **why** it broke (bug classification + root cause)
- Tests **if you understood** (quiz before revealing the fix)
- Tracks **your patterns** (personal bug dashboard over time)

---

## 3. Target Users

| User | Context | Need |
|------|---------|------|
| **CS students** (bootcamp / university) | Learning to code, using AI assistants daily | Understand bugs, not just fix them |
| **Junior developers** | First job, vibe-coding through tickets | Build debugging intuition, stop repeating mistakes |
| **Self-taught devs** | Learning from YouTube / tutorials + AI | Fill knowledge gaps they don't know they have |

**Scope for hackathon:** Web developers working with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React.

## 4. Features

### P0 — Must Ship (Demo-Critical)

| ID | Feature | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| F1 | **Extension Shell** | VS Code extension that activates on web projects, registers commands, and hosts webview panels | Extension installs from VSIX, activates on JS/TS/CSS files, opens side panel |
| F2 | **Diff Detection** | Detects when a file changes (simulating an AI fix) and captures the before/after state | Captures old content vs new content on file save, produces a structured diff |
| F3 | **Visual Diff Panel** | Webview panel showing syntax-highlighted side-by-side or inline diff | Diff renders in a webview with color-coded additions (green) and deletions (red), syntax highlighted |
| F4 | **Bug Classification** | LLM analyzes the diff and classifies into one of 8 bug categories | Returns JSON with category, explanation, concept name, and quiz — under 5 seconds |
| F5 | **"Why It Broke" Explanation** | Plain-English explanation of the root cause displayed in the panel | 2–3 sentence explanation referencing specific lines, readable by a beginner |
| F6 | **Bug Dashboard** | Webview panel showing bug history as charts — category breakdown, trend over time | Heatmap or bar chart of bug categories, line chart of bugs over sessions, "focus area" recommendation |
| F7 | **Demo App** | A small React app with 3–5 pre-planted bugs for the live demo | Each bug is triggerable, fixable, and produces a clear visual change |

### P1 — Should Ship (Strengthens Demo)

| ID | Feature | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| F8 | **Live Preview Panel** | Embedded iframe in VS Code showing the running web app — updates on file change | Webview with iframe pointing to localhost:3000 (or similar), auto-refreshes on save |
| F9 | **"Test Yourself" Quiz** | Before showing the explanation, prompts user with a multiple-choice question | Quiz renders in webview, user selects answer, gets feedback (correct/incorrect + why), then explanation reveals |
| F10 | **Concept Tag** | Links each bug to a CS concept (e.g., "CSS Cascade", "Immutability") | Concept name displayed as a badge/tag below the explanation |
| F11 | **Seed Data** | Pre-populated bug history for demo (simulating a week of student coding) | Dashboard shows realistic data: 15–20 bugs across categories with timestamps |

### P2 — Nice to Have (Polish)

| ID | Feature | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| F12 | **Animations** | Smooth transitions when diff panel opens, quiz slides in, dashboard updates |
| F13 | **Sound/Haptic** | Subtle sound effect on bug classification (optional, adds demo flair) |
| F14 | **Export Report** | "Download your bug report" as PDF/PNG from the dashboard |
| F15 | **Streaks/Gamification** | "You've gone 3 fixes without a CSS bug!" encouragement messages |

## 5. User Stories

### Core Flow
```
AS A student using AI to code,
WHEN I accept an AI-suggested fix,
I WANT to see what changed, why it was broken, and what concept I need to learn,
SO THAT I build real debugging skills instead of just accepting fixes blindly.
```

### Quiz Flow
```
AS A student,
WHEN a bug is detected and classified,
I WANT to be quizzed on what I think went wrong BEFORE seeing the answer,
SO THAT I engage in active recall and learn more effectively.
```

### Dashboard Flow
```
AS A student reviewing my progress,
WHEN I open the Bug Dashboard,
I WANT to see my bug patterns over time with a recommended focus area,
SO THAT I know what concepts to study next.
```

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Extension type | VS Code Webview Extension | Need rich UI panels (diff, quiz, dashboard) — webviews are the only way |
| Diff computation | `diff` npm library | Lightweight, runs in extension host, no external dependencies |
| LLM provider | Claude API (primary), GPT-4o (fallback) | Claude excels at structured JSON output and instruction-following |
| Dashboard rendering | Chart.js in webview | Lighter than Recharts for a standalone webview context (no React dependency in webview needed) |
| Webview framework | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or lightweight (htm + preact) | Keep webview bundle small and fast. No heavy framework needed for 3 panels. |
| State storage | VS Code `globalState` + in-memory array | Simple, no external DB. Seed data loaded on activation for demo. |
| Live preview | Iframe to localhost dev server | Simplest approach — just embed the running app. Refreshes on postMessage from extension. |

## 9. Demo Script (2 Minutes)

| Time | Action | What Judges See |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 0:00–0:20 | **Pitch the problem** | "AI tools fix bugs for you. But fixing isn't learning. Meet FlowFixer." |
| 0:20–0:40 | **Show the broken app** | React app running with a broken button (doesn't respond to clicks). Live preview panel shows the bug. |
| 0:40–1:00 | **Trigger the fix** | "Fix this onClick handler" → file changes → FlowFixer intercepts |
| 1:00–1:10 | **Quiz pops up** | "What do you think went wrong?" — 4 options appear |
| 1:10–1:20 | **Answer the quiz** | Select answer → feedback: "Correct! The handler was bound to the wrong element." |
| 1:20–1:40 | **Explanation reveals** | Visual diff highlights the change. "Why It Broke" card: "Bug Type: Event Binding. Your onClick was on the wrapper div, not the button itself." Concept: "Event Delegation in JavaScript." Live preview updates — button now works. |
| 1:40–2:00 | **Show the dashboard** | Switch to Bug Dashboard. Heatmap shows a week of data. "This student struggles most with State Management and CSS Layout. Recommended focus: React useState." Close with tagline: "Vibe coding makes you fast. FlowFixer makes you fast AND smart." |

---

## 10. Bug Categories (Classification Taxonomy)

| Category | Example Bug | Concept Link |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| CSS Layout / Specificity | `.btn` overridden by `.container .btn` | CSS Cascade & Specificity |
| Null / Undefined Reference | `Cannot read property 'x' of undefined` | Defensive Programming, Optional Chaining |
| Off-by-one Error | `for (i = 0; i <= arr.length)` | Array Indexing, Boundary Conditions |
| Async / Race Condition | State read before `await` resolves | Event Loop, Promises, async/await |
| State Management | Direct mutation of React state | Immutability, React re-rendering |
| Type Mismatch | String concatenation instead of addition | Type Coercion, TypeScript |
| Logic Error | Wrong conditional operator (`&&` vs `\|\|`) | Boolean Logic, De Morgan's Laws |
| Syntax Error | Missing closing bracket, typo in variable name | Syntax Fundamentals |

---

## 11. Planted Demo Bugs

| # | Bug | Category | Visual Effect | The Fix |
|---|-----|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | `onClick` on wrapper `<div>` instead of `<button>` | Event Binding | Button doesn't respond to clicks | Move `onClick` to the `<button>` element |
| 2 | `.btn` styles overridden by `.card .btn` in another stylesheet | CSS Specificity | Button appears unstyled / wrong color | Increase specificity or fix selector |
| 3 | `setCount(count + 1)` inside a closure that captures stale `count` | State Management | Counter increments erratically | Use `setCount(prev => prev + 1)` |
| 4 | `fetch` result used before `await` | Async | Data shows as "undefined" on screen | Add `await` before `fetch` call |
| 5 | `array.length` in condition uses `<=` instead of `<` | Off-by-one | App crashes on last item render | Change `<=` to `<` |

---

## 12. Risk Register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| R1 | VS Code webview takes too long to set up | Medium | High | Start with `yo code` template. Eng 1 owns this exclusively for first 4h. Test webview "hello world" in first 30 min. | Eng 1 |
| R2 | LLM returns inconsistent/bad JSON | Medium | High | Use Claude with `response_format: json`. Add JSON schema validation. Have 3 fallback hardcoded responses for demo bugs. | Eng 3 |
| R3 | Diff detection misses changes or fires incorrectly | Medium | Medium | Use `onWillSaveTextDocument` (captures before) + `onDidSaveTextDocument` (captures after). Test early with manual saves. | Eng 1 |
| R4 | Live preview iframe doesn't refresh reliably | Low | Medium | Fallback: remove live preview from demo, show diff + explanation only. Or use screenshots. | Eng 1 |
| R5 | Demo breaks on stage | Medium | Critical | Pre-plant bugs tested 10+ times. Pre-record backup video. Script every click. | Eng 3 |
| R6 | Run out of time on P1 features | Medium | Low | P0 features alone make a complete demo. Quiz and live preview are enhancement, not core. | All |
| R7 | LLM API rate limits or downtime | Low | Critical | Cache LLM responses for demo bugs locally. If API is down, serve cached responses. | Eng 3 |
| R8 | Team burnout / coordination breakdown | Medium | Medium | Mandatory break at hour 12 (30 min). Sync standups at hours 6, 10, 14, 18. Clear ownership per task. | All |

---

## 13. Definition of Done

### Minimum Viable Demo (must hit all):
- [ ] Extension installs from VSIX on a clean VS Code instance
- [ ] Saving a file with a "fix" triggers the diff panel
- [ ] Diff panel shows syntax-highlighted before/after
- [ ] LLM classification returns category + explanation for at least 3 demo bugs
- [ ] Bug Dashboard displays seeded data with category chart + trend line
- [ ] Full demo flow runs end-to-end without errors 3 consecutive times

### Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Quiz panel works with multiple-choice + feedback
- [ ] Live preview panel shows before/after of running app
- [ ] Animations / transitions between panels
- [ ] Export bug report

---

## 14. Communication Plan

| When | What | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| Hour 0 | Kick-off: confirm roles, set up repo, API keys | All together, in-person |
| Hour 6 | Standup: Track A/B/C/D status, blockers | 5-min standup |
| Hour 10 | Integration check: can all pieces talk to each other? | All together, pair on issues |
| Hour 14 | Demo dry-run #1: test the full flow | All together |
| Hour 18 | Demo dry-run #2: time it, polish script | All together |
| Hour 21 | Final rehearsal: full pitch + demo, no stops | All together |
| Ongoing | Blockers | Shout immediately, don't wait for standup |

## Appendix: Prompt Template

```
You are a coding education assistant analyzing a bug fix. You will receive a diff showing the before (buggy) and after (fixed) code.

## Input
- Language: {{language}}
- File: {{filename}}
- Diff:
{{diff}}

## Instructions
Analyze this diff and respond in JSON:

{
  "category": "one of: CSS Layout / Specificity | Null / Undefined Reference | Off-by-one Error | Async / Race Condition | State Management | Type Mismatch | Logic Error | Syntax Error",
  "explanation": "2-3 sentences explaining WHY the original code was broken. Write for a student. Use plain English. Reference specific lines.",
  "concept": "The CS/programming concept this relates to (e.g., 'Immutability', 'Event Loop')",
  "fix_summary": "One sentence describing what the fix did",
  "quiz": {
    "question": "A question testing if the student understands WHY the bug occurred",
    "options": ["A) ...", "B) ...", "C) ...", "D) ..."],
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Why the correct answer is right and a common wrong answer is wrong"
  }
}

## Rules
- Explain for beginners, not experts
- Reference the actual code in the diff, not abstract concepts
- The quiz should test understanding of the ROOT CAUSE, not just recognition of the fix
- Keep explanation under 50 words
- Keep quiz question under 30 words
```
