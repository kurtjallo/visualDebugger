## 1. Problem Statement

When students and junior developers compile or run their code and hit an error, they're met with a wall of cryptic error messages they don't understand. They can't read stack traces. They don't know what "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined" actually means. So they copy-paste the error into an AI tool, accept the fix, and move on — without ever understanding what went wrong.

**The result:** Students never learn to read error messages. They never build debugging intuition. They can't distinguish a syntax error from a logic error from a runtime crash. They become dependent on AI to fix problems they should be able to diagnose themselves.

---

## 2. Solution

A VS Code extension with a **two-phase learning loop** that activates when a student hits an error:

### Phase 1 — Error Explanation (before the fix)
When the student compiles/runs code and gets an error:
- **Locates** exactly where the bug is in their code
- **Explains** what the error message means in plain English
- **Teaches** how to fix it and how to prevent it in the future
- **Shows** best practices related to this type of bug

### Phase 2 — AI Fix Review (after the fix)
When the student prompts an AI tool (Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT) to fix the code:
- **Shows a visual diff** of what the AI changed (green = added, red = removed)
- **Explains** what the AI did and why that fixes the problem
- **Reinforces** the lesson from Phase 1

### Three Bug Categories
| Category | What It Covers | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Syntax Error** | Code that can't be parsed — missing brackets, typos, malformed expressions | `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` |
| **Logic Error** | Code that runs but produces wrong results — wrong operators, bad conditions, off-by-one | Counter shows wrong number, condition never triggers |
| **Runtime Error** | Code that crashes during execution — null refs, type errors, missing imports | `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` |

---

## 3. Target Users

| User | Context | Need |
|------|---------|------|
| **CS students** (bootcamp / university) | Learning to code, using AI assistants daily | Understand error messages and bugs, not just fix them |
| **Junior developers** | First job, can't read stack traces | Build debugging intuition, learn to self-diagnose |
| **Self-taught devs** | Learning from YouTube / tutorials + AI | Understand the difference between bug types |

**Scope for hackathon:** Web developers working with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript/React.

## 5. User Stories

### Phase 1 — Error Explanation
```
AS A student who just hit a compile/runtime error,
WHEN I see a confusing error message I don't understand,
I WANT FlowFixer to explain where the bug is, what the error means,
  how to fix it, and how to prevent it in the future,
SO THAT I learn to read and understand error messages on my own.
```

### Phase 2 — AI Fix Review
```
AS A student who just asked AI to fix my code,
WHEN the AI changes my file,
I WANT to see exactly what the AI changed (red/green diff)
  and an explanation of what it did and why,
SO THAT I understand the fix instead of blindly accepting it.
```

### Dashboard Flow
```
AS A student reviewing my progress,
WHEN I open the Bug Dashboard,
I WANT to see my bug patterns over time (syntax vs logic vs runtime),
SO THAT I know which type of bugs I struggle with most.
```

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Extension type | VS Code Webview Extension | Need rich UI panels (error explanation, diff, dashboard) — webviews are the only way |
| Error detection | VS Code Diagnostics API + Terminal output parsing | Diagnostics API catches linter/compiler errors; terminal parsing catches runtime crashes |
| Bundler | **esbuild** | Industry standard for VS Code extensions. 100x faster than webpack, builds extension host + webview in parallel |
| Diff computation | **`diff`** npm library + **`diff2html`** for rendering | `diff` computes diffs, `diff2html` renders syntax-highlighted side-by-side/inline diffs out of the box |
| LLM provider | **Gemini API** (primary), Claude API (fallback) | Targets MLH "Best Use of Gemini API" prize. Gemini handles structured JSON output well |
| Dashboard rendering | **Chart.js v4** in webview | Canvas-based, no framework dependency, small bundle, proven in VS Code webviews |
| Webview framework | **`@vscode-elements/elements`** (Lit-based) | Replaced deprecated `@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit`. ~5kb, native VS Code look-and-feel, used by GitLens |
| State storage | **MongoDB Atlas** (primary) + VS Code `globalState` (offline fallback) | Targets MLH "Best Use of MongoDB Atlas" prize. Enables cross-device persistence and richer querying |
| Secrets | **`context.secrets`** API | Encrypted storage for API keys (Gemini, MongoDB, ElevenLabs) |
| TTS | **ElevenLabs API** (P1) | "Read aloud" for bug explanations. Targets MLH "Best Use of ElevenLabs" prize. Accessibility angle |
| Demo app hosting | **DigitalOcean App Platform** | Targets MLH "Best Use of DigitalOcean" prize. Shows production-ready deployment |
| Scaffolding | **`yo code`** (Yeoman) | Still the official standard, no real competitor |

## 7. Core Flows (Detailed)

### Phase 1: Error → Explanation

```
1. Student runs/compiles code
2. Error occurs (terminal output or VS Code diagnostic)
3. Extension captures:
   - Error message (e.g., "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')")
   - File path + line number
   - Surrounding code context (±10 lines around the error)
4. Extension sends to Gemini API:
   - Error message + code context
   - Prompt: "Classify this bug (syntax/logic/runtime), explain it for a beginner"
5. Gemini returns JSON:
   - category: "Runtime Error"
   - location: "line 15, App.tsx"
   - explanation: "You're trying to call .map() on a variable that is undefined..."
   - howToFix: "Check that 'data' is defined before calling .map() on it..."
   - howToPrevent: "Always initialize state with a default value..."
   - bestPractices: "Use optional chaining (data?.map) or provide a fallback..."
6. Error Explanation Panel opens with all info
```

### Phase 2: AI Fix → Diff Review

```
1. Student prompts AI tool (Copilot/Cursor/ChatGPT) to fix the bug
2. AI modifies the file
3. Extension detects file change (onWillSave captures before, onDidSave captures after)
4. Extension computes diff (before vs after)
5. Extension sends diff to Gemini API:
   - Prompt: "Explain what this AI fix changed and why it fixes the problem"
6. Gemini returns JSON:
   - whatChanged: "Added a null check on line 15 before calling .map()"
   - whyItFixes: "The original code assumed 'data' was always an array, but..."
7. Diff Panel opens:
   - Red highlighted: removed/changed code
   - Green highlighted: new code
   - Explanation card: what the AI did and why
```

## 10. Demo Script (2 Minutes)

| Time | Action | What Judges See |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 0:00–0:15 | **Pitch the problem** | "Students hit errors they can't read, paste them into AI, accept the fix, and learn nothing. FlowFixer changes that." |
| 0:15–0:30 | **Show the broken app** | React app running. Student clicks a button — app crashes. Terminal shows: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` |
| 0:30–0:50 | **Phase 1: FlowFixer explains the error** | Error Explanation Panel opens automatically. Shows: bug location (line 15), category badge [Runtime Error], plain-English explanation, "How to fix it", "How to prevent it", best practices. Student now UNDERSTANDS the bug. |
| 0:50–1:10 | **Student asks AI to fix it** | Student prompts Copilot/Cursor: "fix this error". AI modifies the file. |
| 1:10–1:30 | **Phase 2: FlowFixer shows what AI changed** | Diff Panel opens. Red = removed code, Green = new code. Explanation card: "The AI added a null check before calling .map() and initialized the state with an empty array." Student now understands the fix. |
| 1:30–1:45 | **Show the dashboard** | Bug Dashboard with seeded week of data. Bar chart: Runtime (8), Logic (5), Syntax (3). "Focus area: Runtime errors — practice null checking and defensive programming." |
| 1:45–2:00 | **Close with impact** | "FlowFixer turns every error into a lesson and every AI fix into a teachable moment. Vibe coding makes you fast. FlowFixer makes you fast AND smart." |

## 11. Bug Categories (Classification Taxonomy)

| Category | What It Covers | Example Error | Concept Link |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Syntax Error** | Code that can't be parsed — missing brackets, typos, malformed expressions, invalid JSX | `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` | Syntax fundamentals, language grammar |
| **Logic Error** | Code that runs without crashing but produces wrong results — wrong operators, bad conditions, off-by-one, wrong return values | Button does nothing, counter shows wrong number | Boolean logic, control flow, boundary conditions |
| **Runtime Error** | Code that compiles but crashes during execution — null/undefined references, type errors, missing imports, async issues | `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` | Defensive programming, error handling, type safety |

## 12. Planted Demo Bugs

| # | Bug | Category | Error Output | The Fix |
|---|-----|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Missing closing parenthesis in JSX return statement | **Syntax** | `SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ","` | Add the missing `)` to close the return statement |
| 2 | `<=` instead of `<` in loop condition, rendering one extra undefined item | **Logic** | No crash — but app renders an extra empty/broken item in the list | Change `<=` to `<` in the loop condition |
| 3 | Calling `.map()` on state that is `undefined` before fetch resolves | **Runtime** | `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` | Initialize state as `[]` and/or add null check before `.map()` |

## 13. Risk Register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| R1 | VS Code webview takes too long to set up | Medium | High | Start with `yo code` template. Eng 1 owns this exclusively for first 4h. Test webview "hello world" in first 30 min. | Eng 1 |
| R2 | LLM returns inconsistent/bad JSON | Medium | High | Use Gemini with structured output mode. Add JSON schema validation. Have 3 fallback hardcoded responses for demo bugs. | Eng 3 |
| R3 | Error interception misses errors or catches noise | Medium | Medium | Use VS Code Diagnostics API as primary source (reliable). Terminal parsing as secondary. Test with planted bugs early. | Eng 1 |
| R4 | Diff detection misses AI changes or fires on manual saves | Medium | Medium | Track "error active" state — only show diff panel if an error was recently explained. Use `onWillSave` + `onDidSave` pair. | Eng 1 |
| R5 | Demo breaks on stage | Medium | Critical | Pre-plant bugs tested 10+ times. Pre-record backup video. Script every click. | Eng 3 |
| R6 | Run out of time on P1 features | Medium | Low | P0 features alone make a complete demo. Dashboard, quiz, and TTS are enhancement, not core. | All |
| R7 | LLM API rate limits or downtime | Low | Critical | Cache Gemini responses for demo bugs locally. If API is down, fall back to Claude API, then serve cached responses. | Eng 3 |
| R8 | Team burnout / coordination breakdown | Medium | Medium | Mandatory break at hour 12 (30 min). Sync standups at hours 6, 10, 14, 18. Clear ownership per task. | All |
| R9 | MongoDB Atlas connection issues during demo | Low | Medium | Fall back to VS Code globalState for offline storage. Seed data works either way. | Eng 1 |
| R10 | ElevenLabs TTS adds latency to demo | Low | Low | TTS is P1 and optional. Pre-cache audio for demo bugs. Skip button always available. | Eng 2 |

## 14. Definition of Done

### Minimum Viable Demo (must hit all):
- [ ] Extension installs from VSIX on a clean VS Code instance
- [ ] Running code with a bug triggers the Error Explanation Panel (Phase 1)
- [ ] Error Explanation Panel shows: location, category, explanation, how to fix, how to prevent, best practices
- [ ] After an AI fix, the Diff Panel shows syntax-highlighted red/green diff with explanation (Phase 2)
- [ ] LLM correctly classifies and explains all 3 demo bugs (syntax, logic, runtime)
- [ ] Full two-phase demo flow runs end-to-end without errors 3 consecutive times

### Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Bug Dashboard displays seeded data with category chart + trend line
- [ ] Quiz component tests understanding after error explanation
- [ ] ElevenLabs TTS reads explanation aloud
- [ ] Demo app deployed on DigitalOcean
- [ ] Bug history persisted in MongoDB Atlas

## 15. Communication Plan

| When | What | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| Hour 0 | Kick-off: confirm roles, set up repo, API keys | All together, in-person |
| Hour 6 | Standup: Track A/B/C/D status, blockers | 5-min standup |
| Hour 10 | Integration check: can Phase 1 + Phase 2 flows work end-to-end? | All together, pair on issues |
| Hour 14 | Demo dry-run #1: test the full two-phase flow | All together |
| Hour 18 | Demo dry-run #2: time it, polish script | All together |
| Hour 21 | Final rehearsal: full pitch + demo, no stops | All together |
| Ongoing | Blockers | Shout immediately, don't wait for standup |

## Appendix: Prompt Templates

### Phase 1 — Error Explanation Prompt

```
You are a coding education assistant. A student just hit an error they don't understand. Your job is to explain it clearly so they can learn from it.

## Input
- Language: {{language}}
- File: {{filename}}
- Error message: {{errorMessage}}
- Code context (lines around the error):
{{codeContext}}

## Instructions
Analyze this error and respond in JSON:

{
  "category": "one of: Syntax Error | Logic Error | Runtime Error",
  "location": "File and line number where the bug is",
  "explanation": "2-3 sentences explaining what this error message MEANS in plain English. Write for a student who has never seen this error before.",
  "howToFix": "Step-by-step instructions for how to fix this specific bug. Reference the actual code.",
  "howToPrevent": "1-2 sentences on how to avoid this type of bug in the future.",
  "bestPractices": "1-2 sentences on the industry best practice related to this bug type.",
  "quiz": {
    "question": "A question testing if the student understands WHY this error occurred",
    "options": ["A) ...", "B) ...", "C) ...", "D) ..."],
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Why the correct answer is right"
  }
}

## Rules
- Explain for beginners, not experts
- Reference the actual code, not abstract concepts
- The error explanation should decode the error message — what does each part mean?
- Keep explanation under 60 words
- Keep howToFix actionable and specific
```

### Phase 2 — AI Fix Explanation Prompt

```
You are a coding education assistant. A student had a bug, and an AI tool just fixed it. Your job is to explain what the AI changed and why.

## Input
- Language: {{language}}
- File: {{filename}}
- Original error: {{originalError}}
- Diff (before → after):
{{diff}}

## Instructions
Analyze this diff and respond in JSON:

{
  "whatChanged": "1-2 sentences describing exactly what the AI modified in the code",
  "whyItFixes": "2-3 sentences explaining WHY these changes fix the original error. Connect it back to the root cause.",
  "keyTakeaway": "One sentence the student should remember from this fix"
}

## Rules
- Explain for beginners, not experts
- Reference specific lines from the diff
- Connect the fix back to the original error
- Keep whatChanged under 30 words
- Keep whyItFixes under 50 words
```
